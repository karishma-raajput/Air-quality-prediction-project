# Air-quality-prediction-project
Data was collected from machine learning repository . missing value (NaN) were handled through the utilisation of pandas and Numpy libraries
performed data preprocessing and data visualisation using numpy , pandas, matplotlib and seaborn
machine learning model were created  and optimize to achieve precise prediction. interactive visual representation were created .
the final model was implemented as a web service to enable instantaneous air quality forecasts
